This past Saturday I have attended to [PyDay Galicia 2017](https://pyday2017.python-vigo.es/es/). It has been a very interesting one-day conference, with 2 tracks (*Basic* and *Professional*). These are some of the talks I have attended to:

- [Ricardo Samaniego](https://github.com/ricardo-samaniego) talked about [OpenCV con Python](https://github.com/ricardo-samaniego/Meetup-VigoLabs-7/blob/master/20170215_vision_artificial_con_OpenCV.pdf). A very engaging talk with loads of live demos showing the power that a few lines of [OpenCV for Python](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html) can deliver.

- [Clara Casas Castedo](https://github.com/cua-cua) and [Miguel Sánchez de León Peque](https://github.com/Peque) talked about [Python para MacGyvers](https://github.com/cua-cua/Pyday2017-MacGyver/tree/master/notebooks). The idea of the talk is to show the versatility of Python applied to a series of problems, explained in several jupyter notebooks.

- [Miguel González](https://twitter.com/migonzalvar) gave an astounding talk, oddly named **DÃ³nde estÃ¡ mi Ã±**. He recapped the history of language encoding, ranging from Morse to UTF-8, and explained how do encoding and decoding works in Python 3. A 5-stars talk, very illustrative and entertaining.

- [José Juán Montes](https://github.com/jjmontesl) gave two talks. The first one, about ["Automatizacion de hogar con Home Assistant](https://github.com/jjmontesl/talk-hass-pydaygalicia2017/blob/master/home-automation-with-home-assistant.md): a Python package that enables not only a dashboard but a fully-fledged automation system. The second one ([Análisis y visualización de datos con Cubes y CubesViewer](https://github.com/jjmontesl/talk-cubes-olap-pydaygalicia2017/blob/master/README.md)) was about one side project that enables an OLAP front-end and capabilities over SQL backends.

- [Yamila Moreno](https://twitter.com/yamila_moreno) talked about [Cicerón y las comunidades tecnológicas](https://yamila-moreno.github.io/ciceron-y-las-comunidades-tecnologicas/#/). The classic virtues *revisited* in order to boost diversity and inclusiveness in our programming communities. You should check the slides right now :-)

- [Inés Vazquez](https://twitter.com/inesvrios) explained the goals and actions that [Adalab](http://adalab.es/) is performing in order to increase the diversity in our society. In the Q&A after the talk, many attendees showed interest in the subject, commenting that there are no similar initiatives in Vigo.

- [Jose Corral](https://twitter.com/jcleira) gave a talk about the evolution of the technological stack in his company and a brief introduction to Kubernetes.

And after some lightning talks, and a couple of post-event beers, I should say that it has been a very refreshing one-day conference. Kudos to the organizers!
