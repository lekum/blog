I have recently attended to the 2019 edition of [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2019/). These are links to talks that, somehow, I find interesting or relevant:

- [Designing Command-Line Tools People Love](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/designingcli/). Very engaging and though-provoking talk by [@carolynvs](https://twitter.com/carolynvs). Many UX and extensibility-related advice, distilled from the experience she has in creating several battle-tested CLI interfaces.
- [gRPC, Protobufs and Go... OH MY!](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/grpcohmy/). A gentle introduction go gRPC by [@jdg_8](https://twitter.com/jdg_8). A pity that the demo could not be finished, but very nice and easy-to-follow talk.
- [When and How to use CGo](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/gco/). Incredibly useful and engaging talk by [@stillinbeta](https://twitter.com/stillinbeta). The good and the bad parts of CGo. I definitely want to see the recording again and study it in detail.
- [The clusterfuck hidden in the Kubernetes code base](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/kubernetesclusterfuck/). [@krisnova](https://twitter.com/krisnova) unveilled the reason why certain (anti)patters arise in the k8s code base. A good lesson in history of the project and some decisions made.
- [Embedded with Go: from an AWK prototype to a gokrazy appliance](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/embeddedwithgo/). Super-funny talk by [@aissn](https://twitter.com/Aissn) with demo about using a Raspberry-pi powered by [gokrazy](https://github.com/gokrazy/gokrazy) for reading NFC tags and playing MIDI. A good piece of hacking and really worth seeing it.
- [Many lightning talks](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/golightning/), including one by [@rakyll](https://twitter.com/rakyll) about style in packages that is pure gold.
- [Go on microcontrollers](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/go_on_microcontrollers/). Amazing talk by the true showman [@deadprogram](https://twitter.com/deadprogram) about [tinygo](https://tinygo.org/), a promising toolkit to program with Go in resource-limited systems, such as Arduinos or the BBC:Micro. Drones, led stripes, computer vision... don't skip this one. I even went to the Birds Of Feathers meeting later with Ron, about the future plans for the project. Kudos also for [Ayke Van LaÃ«them](https://aykevl.nl/about), one of the main contributors.
