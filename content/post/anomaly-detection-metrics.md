Two months ago I attended to the [Source{d} Infrastructure Tech Talks 2017](http://talks.sourced.tech/infra-2017/). It was a great event with [lots of good talks](http://moduslaborandi.net/2017/03/sourced-tech-talks/). I was lucky to be selected to give a lightning talk about **From 0 to Anomaly Detection in your infrastructure metrics in 15 minutes**. The [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIK5YZaTmhc) is now available online. Thank you very much [Source{d}](https://twitter.com/srcd_) for hosting it!
