Last weekend I attended to [PyConES2017](https://2017.es.pycon.org/), the annual Python conference in Spain. These are some talks and links of things that I have found interesting:

- The Irene ([@irenuchi](https://twitter.com/irenuchi)) and Javier Torres' [workshop](https://2017.es.pycon.org/en/schedule/que-tiene-en-comun-donald-trump-con-los-tacones-en-las-oficinas-de-reino-unido/) on basic geospatial analysis using [GeoPandas](http://geopandas.org/) and [CartoFrames](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartoframes) was amazing. Just download the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/javitonino/talks/blob/master/PyConES_17/GeoPandas/GeoPandas.ipynb) and give it a try!

- Naomi Ceder ([@NaomiCeder](https://twitter.com/NaomiCeder)) gave a keynote named ["Come for the Language, stay for the Community"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HlzmbzDgH9HE2a7wXXXn54Jqtt1llMD7dSRdmKMvytg/edit#slide=id.p) that reinforced the idea that the Python community is somehow special in its openness and newcomers-friendly character. Very inspiring!

- Diego ([@kartones](https://twitter.com/kartones)) gave an interesting talk on [how to refactor their platform while maintaining the service up](https://speakerdeck.com/ticketeaeng/high-impact-refactors-keeping-the-lights-on). Many design patterns applied for a real-life use case.

- Javier Torres explained how he built [an interactive asynchronous shell in Python](https://2017.es.pycon.org/en/schedule/como-complicar-innecesariamente-tu-vida-programando-una-shell-asincrona-en-python/). Thanks to him I have discovered the great Python libraries [ply](https://github.com/dabeaz/ply) (for lexing and parsing) and [prompt_toolkit](https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit) for building interactive CLI applications.

- Miguel González ([@migonzalvar](https://twitter.com/migonzalvar)) gave an amazing talk humorously named [¿DÃ³nde estÃ¡ mi Ã±? ](https://2017.es.pycon.org/en/schedule/da3nde-esta-mi-a/), about encodings, information representation formats and a bit of computing science history. Great!

- Siro ([@Aun_Siro](https://twitter.com/Aun_Siro)) described how he managed to [correct 1000 exams using OpenCV](https://2017.es.pycon.org/en/schedule/corrigiendo-1000-examenes-con-un-pelin-de-opencv/). An impressive hack that made his life easier (at least for some time).

- Pablo Galindo ([@pablogsalgado](https://twitter.com/pablogsalgado)) and Victor Terrón ([@pyctor](https://twitter.com/pyctor)) explained [why metaclasses exist in Python](https://2017.es.pycon.org/en/schedule/metaclases-exactamente-que-y-sobre-todo-por-que/) and even a little introduction on how to use them. A complex subject treated in a fast and funny presentation.

- Yamila Moreno ([@yamila_moreno](https://twitter.com/yamila_moreno)) explained [how to deploy Django applications to a Docker Swarm](https://yamila-moreno.github.io/django-swarm/#slide=1). She showed that combining Continuous Delivery, Docker, Django and orchestration (Swarm) can result in a powerful mix.

- Jara Ramos explained how she [learned Python with 17 years and in 3 months](https://2017.es.pycon.org/en/schedule/python-a-los-17-y-en-3-meses/). A good and motivational talk, fresh and interactive. Watch out for the video :-)

- Alicia Pérez showed [how to develop GIS applications using GeoDjango](https://2017.es.pycon.org/en/schedule/aplicaciones-geograficas-con-django-no-solo-de-javascript-viven-los-mapas/). After a brief introduction into GIS, practical applications of GeoDjango spatial analysis, enough to whet the appetite for more.

- Juan Luis Cano ([@astrojuanlu](https://twitter.com/astrojuanlu)) closed the conference with a keynote about [OpenSource, the cost of maintaining software and other related themes](https://speakerdeck.com/pybonacci/codigo-abierto-mucho-camino-por-delante). Thought-provoking, indeed.

My conclusion is that it has been another great PyConES conference, with that warm fuzzy feeling of a great inclusive community that defines the trademark.
