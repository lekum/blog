This weekend I have attended to [Codemotion 2016](https://2016.codemotion.es/). I have gathered some links of talks and workshops that I consider really worthwile to review:

<!-- TEASER_END -->

- Susana Morcuende ([@yosoytumadre_ti](https://twitter.com/yosoytumadre_ti)), Yamila Moreno ([@yamila_moreno](https://twitter.com/yamila_moreno)) and Jorge Arévalo ([@jorgeas80](https://twitter.com/jorgeas80)) talked about [Los androides no sueñan con ovejas eléctricas; sueñan con conciliar](http://www.slideshare.net/susanamorcuende/losandroidesnoovejasconciliar). It is quite refreshing to find a talk about this important aspect of work. People attending to the talk seemed really interested on the subject and enjoying the talk.

- [Jesus Arnáiz](https://github.com/j-arnaiz) talked about [Máxima productividad con Tmux y Vim](https://github.com/j-arnaiz/codemotion-2016/blob/master/presentation.pdf). This talk was full-packed of great tips and pointers to plugins and other Vim trivia. Fun and practical information.

- Ignacio Sánchez([@drhelius](https://twitter.com/drhelius)) conducted an amazing workshop about [Programación de Emuladores con Go](https://github.com/drhelius/demo-emulator/raw/master/slides/Golang%20Emus.pdf). After a general introduction to emulation and, in particular, to the GameBoy HW/SW, he prepared a [Github repo](https://github.com/drhelius/demo-emulator) with the code of a buggy emulator as an exercise for fixing it by reading the GameBoy documentation and coding the missing emulator operations. Thoroughly prepared, great, great workshop. A perfect 10, congrats!

- Miguel Ángel López ([@MiguelAngel_LV](https://twitter.com/MiguelAngel_LV)) and José Juan Sánchez ([@josejuansanchez](https://twitter.com/josejuansanchez)) conducted a hands-on workshop named [Experimentando con chismes y cacharros](https://github.com/MiguelAngelLV/codemotion2016). Very complete series of exercises, each one building upon the previous one, with kits supplied (for free!) to the participants, creating a multi-sensor IoT device, programmed with the [PlatformIO IDE](http://platformio.org/platformio-ide). A fantastic way to close the conference.
