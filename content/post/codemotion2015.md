The week after the PyConES, I attended to the Codemotion 2015. It is a multitudinary event that summons developers and techies from different communities and languages. The event lasts two days, I was not able to attend on Friday so my review is based exclusively on what I saw on Saturday.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

Roberto Perez ([@hylian](https://twitter.com/hylian)) gave the talk [Rust, el lenguaje que sustituirá a C y C++](https://speakerdeck.com/robjperez/rust-el-lenguaje-que-reeplazara-a-c-y-c-plus-plus). I had a vague idea about Rust and after the talk I would definitely give it a try. Memory safe, easy embbedable, immutability by default and many other features that rock!

Sven Peters ([@svenpet](https://twitter.com/svenpet)) talked about [Coding Culture](https://es.atlassian.com/company/about/events/atlascamp/2015/archives/developer-best-practices/coding-culture/). He described several practices that Atlassian has put into practice around coding culture and happiness, as:

- Give the employees time to innovate
- Stop & celebrate the culture rockstars (small & big wins)
- Use a *mood app* (to daily seize the overall happyiness)
- Write down and make explicit your engineering values
- Strive for transparency. Prefer chat and other persistent technologies to discuss because their nature is more inclusive

Nathan Sowatskey ([@nathandotto](https://twitter.com/nathandotto)) presented *DevOps4Networks*, a talk introducting the concepts of DevOps and Software Defined Networks. He explained that the separation between a data plane that could be implemented via ordinary networking hardware, and a control plane using open standards, is the keystone of SDN. He talked about the promising [OpenDayLight](https://www.opendaylight.org/) project, that aims to abstract heterogeneous network hardware, providing virtualized networking functions with a REST interface. Amazing!

Luis García ([@luiyo](https://twitter.com/luiyo)) spoke about [Concerning Governance in Programming Languages](http://luisgc.github.io/programming_languages_governance/). A refreshing talk about a topic that is not usually subject of discussion in this kind of events: the code governance in the different programming languages. He dissected one by one more than ten different languages and analyzed them according to parameters such as: licensing, openness of the commitees or other groups that drive the development of the language and accesibility for newcomers. I really recommend you to navigate the slides as you may find many surprising facts (and you'll find even a magic cuadrant!)

Luis Martínez ([@lasote](https://twitter.com/lasote)) explaned how we can deploy containers on *Core OS: Tu infraestructura escalable y reproducible*. Nice intro to CoreOS, systemd, etcd and the like.

The last talk I attended to was from Miguel Ángel López ([@miguelangel_lv](https://twitter.com/miguelangel_lv)) and José Juan Sánchez ([@josejuansanchez](https://twitter.com/josejuansanchez)) and it was entitled [Gente que hace cosas con cacharros](https://speakerdeck.com/josejuansanchez/gente-que-hace-cosas-con-cacharros). Super funny talk, with live demos as the tetris tie, the banana music keyboard, the LCD-powered bonsai and many more. They belong the the [Hacklab Almería](http://hacklabalmeria.net/) project, and it seems that they are very active in teaching people how to [make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture). Keep up the good work!
