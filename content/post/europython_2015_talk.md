I've been giving a talk about *Embedding and extending Ansible with Python* at [EuroPython 2015](https://ep2015.europython.eu/conference/talks/extending-and-embedding-ansible-with-python) in Bilbao. The slides of the talk are available [here](http://slides.com/alejandroguiraorodriguez/ee-ansible-with-python#/) and the repo with the source code [here](https://github.com/lekum/ee-ansible-with-python). Thanks everybody!
